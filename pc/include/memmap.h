/**
 * Map a file into the memory of this process.
 * Input parameters:
 *    file:   The name of the file to be mapped.
 *            The file is created if it doesn't exist.
 *    id:     A system wide unique identifier of the mapped region
 *    length: The length of the mapped region.
 *            This parameter is used only if the file doesn't exist, 
 *            otherwise the length of the existing file is used.
 *    overwrite: Overwrite existing files
 * Output parameter:
 *    hReg:   A handle that describes the mapped region.
 * Return value:
 *    0: Successful completion.
 *   -1: An error occured. The cause is specified in the variable errno.  
 *   -2: Not enough memory available.
 *   -3: An error occured. 
 *       The cause may be determined by GetLastError (Windows only).
