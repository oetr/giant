GIAnT (Generic Implementation ANalysis Toolkit) is a platform for physical analysis of (embedded) devices. 
Primarily designed for hardware security analyses, it is built around an FPGA-based board for fault injection and side-channel analysis. 
This project has been supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research BMBF (grant 01IS10026A, Project EXSET).

This is a fork from www.sourceforge.net/projects/giant/.

Notable changes here:
- Allow triggering of fault injection over the EXT1 pin of the smartcard
- Increase the clock frequency of the target to 4MHz from 1MHz
- An example of a fault scan over an AES implementation
